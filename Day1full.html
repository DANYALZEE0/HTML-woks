        <b><mark>HAZRAT ALI : </mark></b>
                ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (Arabic: عَلِيّ بْن أَبِي طَالِب; c. 600 – 661 CE) was the last <del>Caliph</del> <ins>KHALIFA</ins> of the
                Rashidun Caliphate, the successor state to the Islamic prophet Muhammad's political dominions. A senior
                companion of Muhammad, he is considered by Shia Muslims to be the first Imam, the rightful religious and
                political successor to Muhammad. The issue of succession caused a major rift between Muslims and divided
                them into two major branches: Shia following an appointed hereditary leadership among Ali's descendants,
                and Sunni following political dynasties. Ali's assassination in the Grand Mosque of Kufa by a Kharijite
                coincided with the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate. The Imam Ali Shrine and the city of Najaf were built
                around Ali's tomb and it is visited yearly by millions of devotees.[3]
                <br>
                <i><b>Ali was a cousin of Muhammad.</b></i> He was raised by Mohammed from the age of 5 and accepted Mohammed's claim
                of divine revelation by age 11, being among the first to do so. Ali played a pivotal role in the early
                years of Islam while Muhammad was in Mecca and under severe persecution. After Muhammad's relocation to
                Medina in 622, Ali married his daughter Fatima, becoming Mohammed's son-in-law. Ali fathered, among
                others, Hasan and Husayn, the second and third Shia Imams.[4]
